Open RVC-CAL Compiler
=====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orcc/orcc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/orcc/orcc)

Orcc is a development environment under BSD license dedicated to dataflow programming. Its primary purpose is to provide developers with a compiler infrastructure to allow several languages (software and hardware) to be generated from the same description composed of RVC-CAL actors and XDF networks. Orcc does not generate assembly or executable code directly, rather it generates source code that must be compiled by another tool.
